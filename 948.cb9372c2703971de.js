Some of the notable projects that I have worked on are: 1. The Modern Angular Bootcamp: A project that helped me master the fundamentals of Angular, including components, services, pipes, and directives. I learned how to build modular apps that can easily be updated and changed. I also used RxJs to declaratively manage data throughout my app, leveraging built-in functions to transform the data. 2. FreeCodeCamp: Data Structures and Algorithm using JavaScript: A project that helped me grasp the fundamentals of JavaScript, including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions. I also created algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, etc. 3. FreeCodeCamp: Responsive Web Design: A project that helped me become proficient in the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design. I built a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. I also acquired knowledge of how to make web pages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid."),t.qZA())}}),e})()}];let i=(()=>{class e{}return e.\u0275fac=function(o){return new(o||e)},e.\u0275mod=t.oAB({type:e}),e.\u0275inj=t.cJS({imports:[s.Bz.forChild(c),s.Bz]}),e})()}}]);
